## _The flying full stack developer_ 🛩️

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with extensive engineering experience on **agile** teams in the avionics industry. With a tenacious drive and meticulous attention to detail, I have developed cost-saving tools and safety-critical software. I’m always exploring new technologies and tools that benefit my personal and professional projects. I’m also easily excited by airplanes.
